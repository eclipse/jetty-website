    <h2>What is the Eclipse Jetty Project?</h2>
    <p>Eclipse Jetty provides a Web server and javax.servlet container, plus support for HTTP/2, WebSocket, OSGi, JMX, JNDI, JAAS and many other integrations. These components are open source and available for commercial use and distribution.</p>
    <p>Eclipse Jetty is used in a wide variety of projects and products, both in development and production. Jetty can be easily embedded in devices, tools, frameworks, application servers, and clusters. See the Jetty Powered page for more uses of Jetty.</p>
    <p>The current recommended version for use is Jetty 9 which can be obtained on the Jetty Downloads page.<p>
    <p>The Jetty project has been hosted at the Eclipse Foundation since 2009. Prior releases of Jetty have existed in part or completely under the Jetty project at the The Codehaus and Sourceforge before that. See the About page for more information about the history of Jetty.</p>
