        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>We love seeing people contribute patches to the Jetty project and the process is relatively simple.
                The requirements to commit are modest but very important to the Eclipse Foundation and the intellectual property of the open source project.
                The following is the general process by which we operate.</p>

        <div class="ulist">
            <ul>
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>This agreement must be under the <em>same</em> email address as the Git pull request originates from.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The commit must be signed.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>When the pull request is made, a git-hook will validate the email address.</p>

                        <ul>

                                <p>If the result is a green checkbox then the Jetty committers can review the pull request.</p>

                                <p>If the result is a red X then there is absolutely nothing the Jetty committers can do to accept the commit at this point.</p>

            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>When making the commit for the pull request it is  <em>vital</em> that you "sign-off" on the commit using <code>git commit -s</code> option.
                    Without this sign-off, your patch cannot be applied to the Jetty repository because it will be rejected.</p>

                                    One way to think of this is that when you sign the ECA you are indicating that you are free to contribute to eclipse, but that doesn&#8217;t mean everything you ever do can be contributed.
                                    Using the commit signing mechanism indicates that your commit is under the auspices of your agreement.

                    When the Jetty project runs releases we have an automated process that scans for commits with this format for inclusion in our VERSION.txt file.</p>

                    With that in mind, we can only handle pull requests with actively engaged parties.
