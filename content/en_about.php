    <h3>Eclipse Jetty</h3>
    <p>
        Eclipse Jetty Web Server provides an HTTP server and Servlet container capable of serving static and dynamic
        content either from a standalone or embedded instantiations. From jetty-7 on, the jetty web-server and other
        core components are hosted by the Eclipse Foundation. The project provides:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Asynchronous HTTP Server</li>
        <li>Standards based Servlet Container</li>
        <li>websocket server</li>
        <li>http/2 server</li>
        <li>Asynchronous Client (http/1.1, http/2, websocket)</li>
        <li>OSGI, JNDI, JMX, JASPI, AJP support</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Other</h3>
    <p>
        Previous releases of Jetty have been available in many forms and distributions, including the jetty-maven-plugin
        (which is now hosted at eclipse), Debian and RPMs from jetty@codehaus and as part of the Geronimo JEE
        application server from apache.
    </p>

    <h2>Homes</h2>
    <p>
        The Jetty project has found its home in many places over the last 20+ years.
    </p>

    <h2>Eclipse and Github</h2>
    <p>
        In 2009, the Jetty project moved its core components to be a project of the Eclipse Foundation, in order to
        improve the IP processes and broaden the licensing and community of the project. As of Jetty 9 the project has
        fully moved to the Eclipse Foundation. Additionally, in 2016 the project moved the canonical source and issue
        repository to Github.
    </p>

    <h2>Codehaus</h2>
    <p>
        In 2005, the jetty project moved to the The Codehaus for its hosting services and open source community. In
        2009, after the core components of Jetty moved to eclipse, the jetty @ codehaus project continues to provide
        integrations, extensions and packaging of jetty.
    </p>

    <h2>Sourceforge</h2>
    <p>
        From 2000 to 2005, the jetty project was hosted at sourceforge.net where versions 3.x, 4.x and 5.x were
        produced.
    </p>

    <h1>Sponsors</h1>
    <p>
        The development of the Jetty project has been fully funded over the years through close collaboration with a
        great many of wonderful clients. We have done with work through a number of entities as mentioned here.
    </p>

    <h2>Webtide</h2>
    <p>
        In 2015 the development of Jetty was once more taken over by Webtide when the developers split away from
        Intalio, taking over full ownership of the company behind the open source project. <a
                href="https://webtide.com/">Webtide</a> now fully funds the ongoing development of the Jetty project
        through services and support on the open source version of the Jetty project.
    </p>

    <h2>Intalio</h2>
    <p>
        The role of the development of Jetty was taken over in 2009 by Intalio, Inc., who acquired both Webtide and Mort
        Bay. Intalio was a company that offered both products and services based on open source software and they
        employed many of the jetty developers and contributors.
    </p>

    <h2>Webtide</h2>
    <p>
        The role of leading the development of Jetty was taken over in 2006 by Webtide LLC, formed as a joint venture
        between Mort Bay and partners providing marketing, sales and strategic assistance.
    </p>

    <h2>Mort Bay</h2>
    <p>
        The Java HTTP server that became Jetty was originally developed in 1995 by Greg Wilkins of Mort Bay Consulting
        as part of an issue tracking application. Versions 1.x through to 6.1.x of Jetty were developed under
        org.mortbay packaging and Mort Bay still holds the major part of the copyright on the Jetty code base. Mort Bay
        directly hosted the jetty project until version 3.x and was the prime sponsor of development until 6.x.
